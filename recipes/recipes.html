      <h2>Top Five Fan Favorites</h2>
      <p class="description"> To kick off the start of my blog, I wanted to put out my favorite recipes. Picking just 5 is like trying to pick your favorite dog...it is hard. So, I decided to take a poll amongst my taste testers. (Which usually is
        the doormen, and my friend Sammy.) These are everyones five favorite recipes, in no particular order. Aprons on!</p>

        <h3>Banana Bread That Actually Tastes Like Bananas!</h3>

        <aside>
          <img src="images/bananabread.jpg" alt="Banana Bread" title="Banana Bread" />
        </aside>

        <p class="description"> This might seem like a lot of bananas but it really helps increase the banana flavor. Hand chopping the chocolate into shards helps increase the gooeyness and irregular spread of the chocolate! I love to freeze slices
          of the banana bread for a quick snack or bake it into themed large muffin tins for special holidays! Here I made banana bread for my friends for valentines, hence the heart shaped molds. </p>

        <p class="ingredients">Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nonstick vegetable oil spray</li>
          <li>1¾ cups + 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
          <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
          <li>3 large eggs</li>
          <li>1½ cups sugar</li>
          <li>4 large, spotted bananas</li>
          <li>¾ cup vegetable oil</li>
          <li>¾ cup of hand chopped chocolate (any preference)</li>
        </ul>


        <p class="directions">Directions</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350°. Coat a 9x5x3” loaf pan with nonstick spray. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mash bananas.</li>
          <li>Then whisk the eggs, sugar, and oil in into the bananas until smooth.</li>
          <li>Add dry ingredients to banana mixture and stir just until combined.</li>
          <li>In a small bowl or resalable bag, mix the chopped chocolate with 1 tablespoon of flour. Fold by hand, the chocolate-flour mixture into the banana batter. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth top.</li>
          <li>Bake until a tester inserted into the center of bread comes out clean, 60–70 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; let bread cool in pan for 15 minutes. Turn out onto rack and let cool completely.</li>

        <h3>Not Your Average Granola</h3>

        <aside>
          <img src="images/granola.jpg" alt="Granola" title="Not Your Average Granola" />
        </aside>

        <p class="description">The olive oil and tablespoon of salt really adds dimension to this granola. Finding tart cherries can be hard but is completely worth it because they help balance out the salt and sweet from the maple syrup and brown
          sugar. This is a great gift for around the holidays. It’s great on all flavors and types of yogurt, a topping for vanilla bean ice cream, or on its own! Snack away!</p>

        <p class="ingredients">Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
          <li>2¾ cups rolled oats</li>
          <li>1 cup shelled pistachios</li>
          <li>1/3 cup pumpkin seeds</li>
          <li>1 cup unsweetened coconut chips</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
          <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
          <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
          <li>1/3 cup maple syrup</li>
          <li>3/4 cup dried sour cherries (cut the large cherries in half)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="directions">Directions</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 300°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking sheet.</li>
          <li>In a medium bowl, mix together oats, pistachios, pumpkin seeds, coconut chips, and salt.</li>
          <li>In a small saucepan combine brown sugar, olive oil, and maple syrup. Bring heat to medium and whisk until sugar has dissolved. Pour over oat mixture.</li>
          <li>Spread oats along prepared baking sheet. Bake until lightly golden, about 30-40 minutes. Stirring the mixture and rotating the pan every 15 minutes. Remove from oven and mix in dried cherries.</li>
          <li>Let granola completely cool before storing. </li>
        </ol>

        </aside>

        <p class="description">I am known for my brownies. My father’s interior decorator said I could pay him in brownies. The instant coffee ups the chocolate flavor and makes them truly addicting. Unlike other brownie recipes, these are best
          served straight out of the refrigerator... if they last that long!</p>

        <p class="ingredients">Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 pound unsalted butter</li>
          <li>1 pound plus 12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips</li>
          <li>6 ounces unsweetened chocolate</li>
          <li>6 extra-large eggs</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons instant coffee granules</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract</li>
          <li>2½ cups sugar</li>
          <li>2½ cupes all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="directions">Directions</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
          <li>Butter and flour 12 x 18 x 1-inch baking sheet (sheet pan).</li>
          <li>Melt together the butter, 1 pound of chocolate chips, and the unsweetened chocolate in a medium bowl over simmering water. Allow to cool slightly. In a large bowl, stir together the eggs, coffee granules, vanilla, and sugar. Stir the
            warm chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and allow to cool to room temperature.</li>
          <li>In a medium bowl, sift together 1 cup of flour, the baking powder, and salt. Add to the cooled chocolate mixture. Toss 12 ounces of chocolate chips in a medium bowl with 1/4 cup of flour, then add them to the chocolate batter. Pour into
            the baking sheet.</li>
          <li>Bake for 20 minutes, then rap (hit) the baking sheet against the oven shelf to force the air to escape from between the pan and the brownie dough. Bake for about 15 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Do not overbake! Allow to
            cool thoroughly in the pan, refrigerate, and cut into 20 large squares.</li>

          </aside>

          <p class="description">Lemon screams spring and summer to me, which makes these the perfect picnic treat. They are very tart, which makes them a lemon lovers dream. I always keep a few squares in the freezer for my sister. They defrost
            easily and only need a bit more confectioners sugar on top.</p>

          <p class="ingredients">Ingredients</p>
          <ul>
            <p>For the crust:</p>
            <li>1/2 pound unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1//8 tsp kosher salt</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <p>For the filling:</p>
            <li>6 extra-large eggs at room temperature</li>
            <li>3 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons grated lemon zest (4 to 6 lemons)</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="directions">Directions</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>For the crust, cream the butter and sugar until light in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add vanilla extract. Combine the flour and salt and, with the mixer on low, add to the butter until just mixed.
              Dump the dough onto a well-floured board and gather into a ball. Flatten the dough with floured hands and press it into a 9 by 13 by 2-inch baking sheet. Chill until slightly cold.</li>
            <li>Bake the crust for 15 to 20 minutes, until very lightly browned. Let cool on a wire rack. Leave the oven on.</li>
            <li>For the filling, whisk together the eggs, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and flour. Pour over the crust and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the filling is set. Let cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Cut and dust with confectioners' sugar.</li>
