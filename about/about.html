    <p>Hi! My name is Chandler Lauren and I love to bake! For me, baking is a special time where I can leave my troubles behind and focus on the sweeter parts of life! My favorite part about baking is being able to share my creations with family,
      friends, and doormen. I find happiness at William Sonoma and the Container Store. When I am not baking, I am needlepointing, reading, and playing with my puppy. Come with me on my baking journey! I hope you enjoy these as much as I do! </p>
