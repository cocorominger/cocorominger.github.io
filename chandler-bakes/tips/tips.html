      <ul>
        <li>Invest in a silpat, this silicone baking sheet can be used in replace of parchment paper. Not only is it good for the enviornment, as it is reusable, it has great non-stick coating that ensures your baked goods will come out intact!</li>
        <li>There is a difference between regular rubber spatulas and heat proof rubber spautlas. Protip: always go for heat proof...trust me on this one.</li>
        <li>Always coat mix ins like nuts, chocolate chips, berries in flour to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of you dish. Who wants a banana bread with chocolate only on the bottom when you can have it throoughout?</li>
        <li>This may seem like an obvious suggestion but, ALWAYS read the recipe in full before you start or you may miss some steps and ruin your treat.</li>
        <li>Measuring matters! Even if you think you are pretty good at eyeballing measurements...do NOT! Like I mentioned before, baking is a science and you must follow the recipe to a T.</li>
        <li>Always use quality ingredients, there is a different in taste between real vanilla extract and imitation extract. If itâ€™s a simple dessert with minimal ingredients, use real extract or you can taste it.</li>
        <li>Adding instant coffee or instant espresso powder brings out the chocolate flavor in any dish.</li>
      </ul>
